# Stream Continuous Instrument Data into a Live Channel

Stream continuous instrument readings from a Python script or REPL into a named Litmus channel, and watch the operator UI panel update push-style as samples land.

> **Prerequisites.** A station YAML at `stations/{station_id}.yaml` with at least one instrument role declared; a concrete driver class with a single-sample read method (or a self-simulating one like the example below); `litmus serve` running in a separate terminal for the live UI.

## Step 1: Connect to the station

```python
from litmus.connect import connect

with connect("bench_01") as station:
    ...
```

`connect` reads `bench_01` from `stations/bench_01.yaml` (or the `default_station` in `litmus.yaml` when no argument is passed). The `with` block emits `SessionStarted` on entry and `SessionEnded` on exit — Ctrl-C mid-stream triggers clean teardown and leaves partial data on disk.

Outside pytest, this is the entry point. The pytest plugin handles the equivalent session bookkeeping for you during a test run; here you own it directly.

## Step 2: Open a streaming sink

```python
import litmus.channels

with litmus.channels.stream("dmm.voltage") as sink:
    ...
```

`litmus.channels.stream` is a context manager that opens a named ChannelStore sink. The channel name (`dmm.voltage`) becomes the identifier visible in the operator UI and queryable via `channels.query`. Open the sink inside the `connect` block so the session is active when samples land.

## Step 3: Push samples in a loop

```python
import time
import litmus.channels
from litmus.connect import connect

RATE_HZ = 50.0
DURATION_S = 60.0

def main() -> None:
    interval_s = 1.0 / RATE_HZ

    with connect("bench_01") as station:
        dmm = station.instrument("dmm")

        n = int(RATE_HZ * DURATION_S)
        with litmus.channels.stream("dmm.voltage") as sink:
            for i in range(n):
                sink.write(dmm.measure_voltage())
                if i % 50 == 0:
                    print(f"  {i + 1}/{n} samples")
                time.sleep(interval_s)
```

`station.instrument("dmm")` returns the driver instance declared under role `dmm` in the station YAML. Each `sink.write(value)` appends one sample to ChannelStore. `time.sleep` controls the rate; for higher rates, remove it and let the instrument call pace the loop.

A minimal `stations/bench_01.yaml` for this example:

```yaml
id: bench_01
name: Bench 01
station_type: bench
instruments:
  dmm:
    type: dmm
    driver: drivers.DMM
    resource: TCPIP::192.168.1.102::INSTR
```

## Step 4: Watch live in the operator UI

Open `http://localhost:8000/channels/dmm.voltage`. The channel panel appears once the first sample lands and updates push-style as subsequent samples arrive — no page reload. The chart is fed by a Flight subscription wired in at `litmus serve` startup, not by polling.

Run the script a second time and both sessions' samples appear on the same `dmm.voltage` timeline. ChannelStore files are session-scoped on disk; the UI unifies them by channel name. To scope a query to a single session, pass `session_id=` to [channel queries](querying-channels.md).
