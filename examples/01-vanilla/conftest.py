"""PSU and DMM fixtures — real driver classes, optionally mocked.

Tests are written against the real ``DMM`` / ``PSU`` driver classes
in ``drivers/``. When ``--mock-instruments`` is set (or
``mock_instruments: true`` in ``testerkit.yaml``), TesterKit's ``Mock``
factory wraps the real driver class with explicit return values so
the tests run end-to-end without a bench attached. Without the
flag, the fixtures connect to the configured VISA resources.

This is the same conditional shape the TesterKit plugin uses
internally (``testerkit/pytest_plugin.py``) — the test code calls
the real driver methods regardless. Stage 5 lifts this conditional
out of ``conftest.py`` into station YAML.
