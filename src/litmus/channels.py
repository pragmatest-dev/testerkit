"""Power-user channel-write surface — items 7 / 8.

The test-author shape is :func:`stream` (a bare verb exposed via the
``stream`` pytest fixture; see :mod:`litmus.pytest_plugin`). Power
users — driver code, multi-channel sweeps, cross-vector recorders —
reach for these explicit forms:

- :func:`write` — one-shot append-a-sample to a named channel
- :func:`stream` — context-managed sink with ``.write(sample)`` /
  ``.close()``

Both route to the active ChannelStore via
:func:`litmus.execution._state.get_channel_store`. The channel kind
is pinned on first write per the C2 kind-registry rule; subsequent
writes that violate the type-stability raise.

Per §3 of the design doc, ``channels.write`` is semantically
identical to the bare ``stream`` verb — one channel write per call.
The split is API clarity: ``stream(...)`` for test-author intent
("push this sample"); ``channels.write(...)`` for power-user
explicit ("write to this specific store, no auto-association").
